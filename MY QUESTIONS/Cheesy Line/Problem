"Why me?" ,zing asked.

"If you're a star then I'm the darkness.You complete me ",he replied.

Being impressed by him, she gave him an another task.

Build a tree with following rules:

If a node with (l,r) is given
Break it into left node with (l,mid)
Break it into right node with (mid+1,r)
stop when leaf node appears (l=r)
where mid=(l+r)/2.

So count the number of leaf nodes which do not appear in pairs.

For more clarification,see examples below.

Input
Line 1: No. of queries (<=100000)

Line 2: In next q lines , l r is given (0<=l<=r<=10^18) 

Output
For every query, print the answer.

Example
Input:
2
2 4
4 5
Output:
1
0
Explanation : In (2,4) --> (2,3) and (4,4)
                        (2,3) --> (2,2) and (3,3)
                        Here (4,4) is the only leaf node which did'nt appear in pair.
